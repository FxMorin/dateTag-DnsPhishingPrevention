# PhisHault-dateTag
dateTag is a powerful tag that can easily identify a phishing site. dateTag is currently part of a larger project that will be released in a couple of months. dateTag alone is able to identify DNS Phishing attacks, when combined with the full system coming soon, it can also detect phishing sites.

## COMING SOON
We are working on a much more complex version of this system but for the time being, no explination will be available. A short example of the api usage & basic instructions will be coming out in 2-3 weeks
