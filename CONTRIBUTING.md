## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for dateTag, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.


#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After that create an issue on the repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most dateTag users & why they would want this feature to be added.
* **Specify which version of dateTag you're using.** You can get the exact version at the top of the dateTag.php file.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to dateTag?
dateTag is writtin in PHP although we need many other programming languages for website tags & post requests. If you know any other programming languages, this would be a great place to start!
Other then that, ask around. Someone may want a feature or bug fix added!

#### Local development

I need to add this part

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain dateTag's preformance
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible dateTag
- Enable a sustainable system for dateTag's maintainers to review contributions

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
